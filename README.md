# Music Player: A Spotify-inspired app
A full stack music website using React and API calls from RapidAPI to pull the most updated Top Songs, Top Artist, and other information.

### Technologies Used
- React
- RapidAPI

### Run the Program
To run the Music Player program on your local device:
1. Clone the github repo to your IDE (I personally use VSCode)
2. In the terminal, run `npm run dev`

### Usage Instructions
Once you have the application running on your local device, explore! You can explore different songs by genre,
see any top charts and top artists, listen to the music, or see the lyrics for your favorite songs!<br>
*Note: Unfortunately, the ShazamCore API is a paid service that I have decided to stop paying for, as this was a casual and fun learning project. As such,
running the app may not work as expected.*
